\chapter{Conclusion and Future work}
\label{ch:conclusion}

To Summarize succinctly, authors \txti{Tommaso} et.al., in the work \txti{“                            ”} propose a different approach for 

These findings calls for a firm case for expanding and exploring the proposed technique further. The technique must be evaluated over the other application domains apart from the mentioned ones to test the versatility of the approach. Also, the datasets that are not particularly rich in Ontology are to be tested with, to see how it particularly fares against that of Information Gain. Further work also calls out for evaluating against other measures such as serendipity and unexpectedness etc., The authors intend to take the next step for the proposed method by considering similarities with multi-hop between entities. These would result in a more complex subgraphs that are estimated to be relevant for LD-based RSs.
